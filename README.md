# Module 1 Challenge
## Refactoring Starter Code
## Description

For the Module 1 Challenge, our goal was to refactor existing code for a digital marketing webpage. When I visited the page, I noticed that one of the titles in the banner did not link to information on the page like the others. I also noticed that the images did not have an 'alt' code for accessibility for visually impaired users. To repair the link, I looked at the codes in the index and found that an id tag was missing. For the images, I added an alt tag and a brief description. I also added a README page by copying the one in our prework and filling in the information to explain what I did for this project. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Users will find brief descriptions of Horiseon's marketing tools linked to the titles on the right side of the banner at the top of the page.
